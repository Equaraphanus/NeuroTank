# Neuro Tank

## Briefly about the project
An unfinished and almost abandoned project I started locally a couple of days before 2020 New Year.
I may come back to this project at some point in the future.
The project definitely needs refactoring and rethinking, and it will probably be easier to start over using this as a base.
So I cleaned it up a little and now it is hopefully ready for improvements.

## The initial goal
The goal was to write a simulation for virtual tank-like creatures controlled by simple neural networks and evolve them so they would (hopefully) learn how to interact with the world and survive there.

## What went wrong
I could not figure out how to calculate fitness score in this case and just gave up eventually.

## What has been achieved
- The engine is complete enough for now
- The entity and quad systems are implemented
- The inspector is mostly done
- The neural networks are working
- The simulation environment is ready

## What I learned in the process
- How to implement neural networks from scratch
- What is a quad system and how to implement it
- Finding a good fitness function is hard...
